I bought all necessary things from the market. We invited all our close friends and relatives.

I cut the cake after blowing the candles. Everyone sang the birthday song. Tasty dishes,
including hot tea and coffee were served. Everyone enjoyed the party. 
The guests presented me wonderful gifts. My father gifted me a Titan wrist watch.
It is a beautiful and very useful gift for me. I enjoyed the party a lot.

Oh! how I missed you on that day! But you had your compulsions. Anyway, please convey my regards to your parents.
